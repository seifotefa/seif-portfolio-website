# *experience: mec consulting 2025*

## **the beginning**  
this year’s mec consulting competition started off with a curveball, two of our team members couldn’t make it at the beginning.  
<br> with only two of us present at the start, we had to rethink our workflow, split responsibilities, and keep the project moving with half the manpower.  

<br> the challenge prompt focused on something massive and deeply relevant: **the future of healthcare in canada**.  
from demographics to digital infrastructure, we were analyzing a system that affects millions of people every day.

## **the challenge**  
competitions like mec consulting don’t just test knowledge — they test adaptability.  
<br> we were given limited time to research the current state of canada’s healthcare system, diagnose the structural issues, and propose a forward-looking strategy that was realistic, data-driven, and actionable.  


## **the solution**  
our final proposal focused on three pillars that canada needs in order to build a sustainable and modern healthcare system:  
<br> **workforce redesign**, **digital transformation**, and **scalable funding models**.  

<br> we emphasized hybrid care, ai-driven triage systems, integrated medical records, and better resource allocation, not just buzzwords, but long-term, feasible steps toward a resilient system.



## **the moment**  
after hours of research, modelling, strategy building, and refining our pitch, we delivered a presentation we were genuinely proud of.  
<br> it balanced innovation with realism, and it told a clear story of where canadian healthcare could go in the next decade — and how to get there.

<br> hearing our team announced as **1st place winners** felt unreal, especially knowing how the day began.

## **what i learned**  
consulting isn’t just about giving meaningless advice, it’s about understanding systems at scale, identifying constraints, and communicating solutions clearly.  
<br> working through this challenge taught me how to combine analytics, strategy, and narrative into one cohesive recommendation.  

<br> it also reinforced the importance of composure: even when the situation isn’t ideal, the work still has to get done.

## **the takeaway**  
winning first place meant more than a certificate, it earned us the chance to compete at the Ontario Engineering Competition in January, representing McMaster for the consulting category, which I can't wait to do.
