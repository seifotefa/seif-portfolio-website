# *project deep dive: jinsa*

## **the beginning** 
jinsa began as our ambitious idea for spurhacks 2025 — a weekend-long hackathon where teams came together to build something impactful.  
<br> our concept was simple but bold: a decentralized platform using blockchain to authenticate real-world products.  

<br> whether it was fashion, collectibles, or electronics, we wanted users to verify authenticity instantly — cutting through counterfeits and restoring trust between brands and consumers.

## **the pivot**  
at the start, everything moved fast. we brainstormed, sketched out features, and began building what would become the foundation of jinsa.  
<br> but as the hackathon hours ticked by, reality hit — we had aimed too big for a 36-hour window.  

<br> our vision was solid, but a full mvp wasn’t realistic. so instead of forcing a rushed prototype, we made a decision that changed everything: we pivoted from the hackathon track to the startup track.  

## **the shift** 
instead of building the mvp out, we focused on understanding the market, users, business model, and scalability of jinsa.  
<br> even though we didn’t place among the winners, our pivot caught the organizers’ attention — and we were invited to join the spur startup accelerator program.

## **the accelerator**  
over the following weeks, we shifted from just “building a cool app” to understanding what it takes to build a *company*.  
<br> we learned how to validate our product idea, define a target market, and craft a story that investors and users could believe in.

## **what i learned**
i spent much of that time diving deep into blockchain fundamentals — not just how it works, but how it could be applied meaningfully beyond hype.  
<br> we explored token standards, supply chain use cases, and different ways to connect physical assets to digital tokens.  

<br> it was the first time i saw how technology, business, and storytelling could blend together to form something bigger than a project.  

## **the takeaway**  
even though we decided not to launch jinsa as a full startup, the experience left a lasting impact.  
<br> it taught me how to think like a founder — how to prioritize, pivot, and communicate vision under uncertainty. i also witnessed the waterloo culture firsthand, showing me the amount of talent and potential in the gta when it comes to building the future, no matter the industry.

<br> more than that, it showed me what it feels like to chase an idea that’s slightly out of reach, and to learn from the process of trying to make it real.  
<br> jinsa didn’t end in a product release, but it became one of the most valuable learning experiences i’ve had in turning ideas into something tangible.
