# *Code in Place 2025*
<br /><br />
This spring, I had the privilege of serving as a Section Leader for Stanford's Code in Place program.<br /><br />

**teaching code in place – spring 2025**<br />

in early 2025, i applied to be a section leader for [code in place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), an initiative run by stanford university to teach the world how to code for free.<br /><br />

the application asked about my motivation, my teaching experience (if any), why i cared, and had me solve some technical questions.<br />
it felt like the kind of opportunity i'd been looking for: a way to give back, to teach, to challenge myself, and to be part of something much bigger.<br /><br />

**week 0 – meeting my section**<br />

after being accepted, i was assigned to a group of 15 students from around the world.<br /><br />
our shared goal: get through six weeks of cs106a (stanford's  intro to python course), together.<br /><br />
each week, we met live on zoom. we walked through code examples, solved problems, and talked about loops, conditionals, and debugging.<br />
i tried to keep the sessions light, hands-on, and human.<br />
i wanted them to feel confident not just with python, but with the idea that they *could* learn to code.<br /><br />

**what i learned**<br />

teaching isn't just about knowing something, it's about understanding how someone else might not.<br />
i learned to explain things clearly, to pause more often, to listen better.<br /><br />
i got better at breaking down logic and reading between the lines when a student was stuck.<br /><br />
sometimes, it wasn't about the code at all, it was about encouragement and having them slowly answer their question themselves.<br /><br />
i also noticed that teaching a subject, makes you understand it way better.<br /><br />

**why it mattered**<br />

code in place reminded me that computer science can be a deeply human thing.<br />
it's not just algorithms and syntax, it's storytelling, problem solving, and building things that matter.<br /><br />

i'm grateful for the chance to teach, to learn, and to be part of a global classroom.<br />
and i'm proud to have helped 15 new programmers take their very first steps.
